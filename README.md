# HTML CSS Task
  
We have received a new mockup from the graphics department! This one is going to be a standalone page so there is no need for php or any kind of CMS framework.  
  
What we need from you is to replicate the <a href="/mockup.png">mockup.png</a> in html and css. You'll find the image assets as well as an icon font pack we like to use called 'Icomoon' in the assets folder.

  You'll need to implement the icomoon font to create some of the icons you'll see in the mockup, you'll find icomoon specific instructions inside the icomoon zip
  
  Don't worry about links or where they go to, just set them all to link to www.example.com
  
  When complete, please zip your code along with a short write up of how you addressed the task. Send this to your contact at Blackstone. We prefer google drive for the large files, but other services can also work.
